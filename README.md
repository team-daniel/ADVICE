### Getting Started
All of the code and packages necessary to implement FairVIC are contained within a tutorial Jupyter Notebook in this repository. This notebook will guide you step by step into using FairVIC in a standard neural network. We encourage you to tweak parameters, weights, and models to highlight the power of FairVIC.

### Files
This repository contains the following files:
* `src/`
  * `encoder_shield\adpt\shield.py` - The main source code behind our method. This includes the adaptive shield extension.
  * `buffer.py` - Source code for a replay buffer.
  * `noise.py` - Source code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.
  * `main.py` - Source code for running the source code and saving results/models.
* `overview.png` - A high-level overview of ADVICE including training, inference, and the adaptive extension.
