### Getting Started
All of the code and packages necessary to implement FairVIC are contained within a tutorial Jupyter Notebook in this repository. This notebook will guide you step by step into using FairVIC in a standard neural network. We encourage you to tweak parameters, weights, and models to highlight the power of FairVIC.

### Files
This repository contains the following files:
* `ECAISupplementaryCode.ipynb` - A detailed Jupyter Notebook that will guide readers through using FairVIC.
* `fairVIC.png` - A high-level overview image of how FairVIC is incorporated within the training of a neural network.
